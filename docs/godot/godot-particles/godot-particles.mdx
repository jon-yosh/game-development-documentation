## Particles3D
1. Add **GPUParticles3D** to your scene
![](./assets/add-gpu-particles.png)

2. A yellow bounding box appears which is the distance that the particles can be seen from
![](./assets/yellow-bounding-box.png)

3. Move the **GPUParticles3D** to where you want the particles to emerge from
![](./assets/move-particles.png)

4. Add a mesh for the particles under **Draw Passes** in **Pass 1**
![](./assets/add-pass.png)

5. Create a **New ParticleProcessMaterial** under **Process Material**
![](./assets/add-particle-process-material.png)

6. Particles will begin to emerge, make sure you resize the mesh so that you can see how the particles react

### Instantiating GPUParticles3D Programmatically
1. Export variable
```
@export var muzzle_flash: GPUParticles3D
```
