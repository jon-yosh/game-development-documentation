# Rigging Bodies

## Build the Armature
1. It's easiest to start with a model in an **A-Pose**

2. Move **3D Cursor** to **World Origin** with **Shift + S** then **Shift + A** and create **Armature**. An alternative method is to create an armature then use **Alt + G** to remove movement

3. Move the **Armature** to where the bottom of the spine would be. Make sure you enable **Data > Viewport Display > In Front** to see the bones

4. Create 4 bones for the body, 1 for the neck, and 1 for the head
![](./assets/bones-for-body-neck-head.png)

5. make sure that the bones line up to the middle of the mesh

6. To create a linked bone use **Shift + D** on the bone closest to the shoulder, then select the joint and press **G**

> If you made a mistake to unlink use **Alt + P** then **Clear Parent**
> ![](./assets/clear-parent.png)
> To reconnect you can press **Ctrl + P** then select **Keep Offset**

7. When creating the arm move the bone to the elbow just to make sure that the length is good

8. Create a bone to the wrist

9. Now we can move out elbow bone into position in the middle, because we know it lines up now

10. In order to have a high-quality armature, we should rotate the bones so that the face forward

11. Create a leg bone with **Shift + D** adjust the bones, then clear parent with **Alt + P** and reconnect to the bottom of the spine with **Ctrl + P**

## Symmetrize Bones in Armature
1. Rename a bone with **F2**
![](./assets/rename-with-f2.png)

2. You can also rename in the **Bone Menu**
![](./assets/rename-in-bone-menu.png)

3. To enable bone names go to **Armature Data Menu** and enable **Viewport Display > Names**
![](./assets/enable-bone-names.png)

4. In order for the **Symmetrize** Bones system to work you need to follow these naming conventions
![](./assets/symmetrize-naming-conventions.png)

5. The important naming conventions are legs and arms. Example:
- Left Leg:
```
thigh_l
calf_l
foot_l
```

- Left Arm:
```
upper arm_l
lower arm_l
hand_l
```

6. **Right-Click** on the arm bones and leg bones them select **Symmetrize**

7. You should now have both sides of the armature

## Creating IK (Inverse Kinematics)
1. Create a `pole_l` and `target_l` bones above the knee and behind the heel. Make sure you deselect **Bone > Deform**. Clear parents for both of those bones with **Alt + P**
![](./assets/create-ik-bones.png)

2. In **Pose Mode** select the `calf_l` bone and select **Bone Constraints** and add a **Inverse Kinematics** Constraint
![](./assets/pose-mode-add-ik.png)

3. The **Target** is the armature and since we only have one just select **Armature** for **Bone** select the `target_l` bone. For **Pole Target** select the **Armature** again then select `pole_l` for the **Bone**. The whole skeleton might be angled, to which we need to change the **Chain Length** to 2, because we have two bones in the leg. We then need to change the **Pole Angle** so that our knee appears correct

4. Go into **Edit Mode** then select the leg and **Right-Click** to symmetrize the IK
![](./assets/symmetrize-ik-bones.gif)

5. Parent the mesh to the **Armature** by going into **Object Mode** selecting the mesh first then the armature second. We then can parent with **Ctrl + P** and selecting **With Automatic Weights**
![](./assets/parent-mesh-to-armature.gif)

6. To parent the head go into **Pose Mode** select the head bone, then select the TV and make sure the bones are the **Active Object** now you can press **Ctrl + P** then select **Bone**
![](./assets/parent-head-to-armature.gif)

## Weight Painting
1. To enter **Weight Paint** Mode and edit the weights for each bone first select the **Armature** in **Object Mode** then **Shift** select the **Mesh** so that both are selected. Now you can enter **Weight Paint** Mode using **Tab**. You can select a bone by **Shift + Ctrl + Click** the bone

> When weight painting it's based on vertives so if you experience a weird snapping feeling, it is most likely due to the fact that the mesh is low poly.

2. Paint the weights on your character, make sure that **Weight** is set to **1.000**, if you want to remove weight hold **Ctrl** and paint
![](./assets/use-solid-weights.png)

3. A useful tip is to move the arms and legs into various positions to check for any creases in the mesh. This way you can paint accordingly

4. Use **Alt + R** and **Alt + G** to reset any rotation or movement you may have done
