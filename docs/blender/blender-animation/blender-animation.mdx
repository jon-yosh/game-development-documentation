# Blender Animation

## Animation Prep

1. You may want to put separate objects as children to an **Empty**

2. Rename the **Empty** to something that makes sense, like a controller
![](./assets/rename-empty.png)

3. Select all the objects you want to include and make sure that the **Empty** is the **Active Object** by **Ctrl+Clicking** it

4. Now select **Object > Parent > Object**

5. You can do this for multiple parents nested inside, this will allow for animation to be easier

## Animation
1. Select the **Animation** Workspace

2. Update your **Frame Rate** to desired amount

3. Set **Playhead** to starting position

4. Press **I** in the **3D Viewport** to add keyframes

> Note: You can also just enable the **Record** Button which will create keyframes whenever you move an object. Watch out for accidentally creating keyframes when you do not want to

> If you want more specified properties, press **K** to bring up the **Keyframe Menu**

5. Add a second keyframe

6. Make the **End** match with when you want the animation to terminate

## Graph Editor
1. Open the **Graph Editor**
![](./assets/open-graph-editor.png)

2. We can edit in the **Graph Editor** just like with the **Dopesheet**

3. You can edit **Interpolation Modes** by going into **Key > Interpolation Mode**
![](./assets/interpolation-mode-menu.png)

4. Test out the interpolation modes to help the type of animation you are trying to accomplish

5. To reduce the length you can scale based on the playhead. First update the pivot point
![](./assets/update-animation-pivot-point.png)

6. Now you can scale based on the playhead, so put the playhead at 0 then press **S** to scale then **X** along the x-axis
