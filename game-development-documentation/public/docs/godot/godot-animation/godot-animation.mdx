4. Now all the transforms have keys that you can add as keyframes to your animation

5. When you add a keyframe Godot asks if you want to **Create RESET Track(s)** select **Create**

> **RESET Tracks** help return properties back to their original values when an animation finishes. If an animation opens a door the RESET track restores the door to its closed position when the animation is done

6. Example of a completed track. You can even animation materials!

7. If you want to access the animation from the script. You can use an onready variable to access the **AnimationPlayer**
```
@onready var animation_player: AnimationPlayer = $AnimationPlayer
```

8. Then you can call the animation like this
```
...
if provoked:
    if distance <= attack_range:
        animation_player.play("Attack")
...
```

### Adding Script Functions to the AnimationPlayer
1. We can call this variable from the **AnimationPlayer** by adding a new track
```
func attack() -> void:
	print("Enemy Attack")
```

2. Click on **Add Track** in the **Animation** window and select **Call Method Track...**
