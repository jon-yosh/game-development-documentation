# 🎨 Blender Creation Steps

---

## 📝 **1. Planning & Reference**
> *Know what you're making*

- 📐 Sketch or concept art
- 📏 Define scale and proportions
- 🎯 Set poly budget (low-poly for indie games)
- 📚 Gather reference images

---

## 🔷 **2. Blocking/Base Mesh**
> *Get the shape right*

- 📦 Start with basic primitives (cube, cylinder, sphere)
- ✂️ Use basic operations (extrude, inset, loop cuts)
- 🎯 Focus on silhouette and proportions
- 🚫 **No details yet - keep it simple!**

---

## 🔧 **3. Modeling & Refinement**
> *Add necessary detail*

- 🔄 Refine the mesh with good topology  
- ➕ Add important details only
- 🔍 Check from game camera distance
- 📐 Keep quads when possible, triangles are okay

---

## 🎨 **4. UV Unwrapping**
> *Prepare for textures*

- 📐 Mark seams strategically
- 🗺️ Unwrap and layout UVs efficiently
- 📏 Check for stretching and distortion
- 💾 **Save often - UV work can be tedious!**

---

## 🖌️ **5. Texturing & Materials**
> *Bring it to life*

- 🎨 Create or find textures (keep them small for games)
- 🔗 Set up material nodes in Shader Editor
- 🌟 Test with game lighting conditions
- 📱 Remember: Simple materials = better performance

---

## 📦 **6. Export & Integration**
> *Get it into your game*

- 🔄 Apply all modifiers
- 📐 Check scale (Godot uses meters)
- 💾 Export as .gltf
- 🎮 Test in game engine immediately

---

### 🎯 **Game Asset Tips**
- **Keep it simple**: Details players won't see are wasted polygons
- **Consistent style**: All assets should feel like they belong together  
- **Test early**: Import into Godot frequently to check scale and performance

### ⚠️ **Common Mistakes**
- Making models too detailed for the camera distance
- Forgetting to check scale before exporting
- Over-complicating materials for simple game graphics
