# Blender Animation

## Animation Prep

1. You may want to put separate objects as children to an **Empty**

2. Rename the **Empty** to something that makes sense, like a controller

3. Select all the objects you want to include and make sure that the **Empty** is the **Active Object** by **Ctrl+Clicking** it

4. Now select **Object > Parent > Object**

5. You can do this for multiple parents nested inside, this will allow for animation to be easier
