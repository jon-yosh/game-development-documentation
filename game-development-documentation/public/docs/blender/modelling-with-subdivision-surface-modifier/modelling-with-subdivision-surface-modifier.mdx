# Modelling With Subdivision Surface Modifier

To easily create a **Subdivision Surface Modifier** you can you

| **CMD + 2** | ![](./assets/level-2-subdivision.png) |
| **CMD + 3** | ![](./assets/level-3-subdivision.png) |

It is a good idea to set the **Render** as higher than the **Viewport**, so that it is easier to model and having a smoother render

## Example of Modelling Workflow
1. Add a subdivision surface modifier with the method above

2. Add a mirror using **AutoMirror**

3. Add loop cuts **Ctrl + R** to add more form to your model. You can edge slide with **GG**

4. You can also use **E** to extrude, and you can develop a TV looking model

5. You can separate the screen to make it easier to model by pressing **P** then **Selection**

6. You may notice that there is a weird visual issue. This is due to the **Modifier Stack**

7. To fix: reorder the modifiers so that the **Mirror Modifier** is first then the **Subdivision Surface Modifier**

8. You can select both parts and **Shade Smooth**

9. You can add a **Subsurface Modifier** to the cylinder, but it has anomalies

10. To fix anomalies inset with **I** twice, and it is a good idea to **Shade Smooth** again

## Create a Body
1. Create a block person using a cube, with a mirror modifier then extruding to create limbs

2. Add a **Subdivision Surface Modifier**

3. Make sure you **Shade Smooth**

### Preparing Body for Rig
1. To allow for proper bending in the joints use **Ctrl + B** to Bevel and add more topology

2. You can set the **3D Cursor** near the arm and change the pivot point to the **3D Cursor** to move the arm downward

3. Fix any pinching around the shoulder, and move the elbow out to make it easier to tell where it is. Now our model is in an **A-Pose** so it will make it easier to rig
